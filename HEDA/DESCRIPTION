Description: HEDA is designed to identify hydropeaking events from raw time-series flow record, a rapid flow variantion induced by the hourly-adjusted electricity market. <br />The novelty of HEDA is to use vector angle instead of the first-order derivative to detect change points which not only largely improves the computing efficiency but also accounts for the rate of change of the flow variation.
